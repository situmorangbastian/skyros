This project aims to build a simple e-commerce backend system using a **microservices architecture**, with **gRPC for inter-service communication**and an **API Gateway** to expose a unified RESTful interface to clients. Each core functionality of the e-commerce system is encapsulated in its own microservice to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a simple e-commerce backend system built using a **microservices architecture**, where each core functionality is isolated into independent services. These microservices communicate using **gRPC**, and a centralized **API Gateway** exposes a unified RESTful API interface to external clients.

The project demonstrates a scalable and maintainable approach to backend development suitable for modern distributed systems.

## 🧩 Key Features

- **API Gateway**
  - Acts as a single entry point for all client requests
  - Routes requests to corresponding microservices using gRPC
  - Handles authentication and request validation

- **Microservices**
  - **User Service**: User registration, login and authentication (JWT)
  - **Product Service**: Product management
  - **Order Service**: Order management

- **gRPC Communication**
  - All internal service communication uses high-performance gRPC
  - Service contracts defined via Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)

- **Database per Service**
  - Each microservice maintains its own isolated database
  - Promotes data encapsulation and service independence
